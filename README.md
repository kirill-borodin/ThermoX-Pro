# ThermoX-Pro
Qt program to calculate heat flux during experiments on hypersonic facilities

The program reads a field of temperature taken by an infrared imager, mathematically processes the set of images as a set of functions, calculates heat flux and heat transfer coefficient, and writes this data in Tecplot files
